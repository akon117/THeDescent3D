# TheDescent3D

Hello! Welcome to *The Descent 3D* public repository! This game, which is a remake of the 2D game [*The Descent*](https://nipshot.itch.io/the-descent), was made as a submission to the UTSA Rowdyhacks 2023 hackathon.

This game was built in Unity using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), and also used the LeanTween library, Unity's Ink integration library and the Unity Cinemachine library.

Play the game on itch.io [here!](https://nipshot.itch.io/the-descent-3d)
